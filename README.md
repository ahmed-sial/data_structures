# data_structures
Data Structures in Java.
Here are practice problems from absolute beginners to advanced data structures in purely java.
The file that exits in the main directory(data_structures), simply run javac file_name; java file_name espesially in Linux/Mac OS, if you are using Windows then most probably you are using IDE.
For the subdirectories of main directory, go into directory you want (then clone or download it) and run javac Main.java; java Main.
